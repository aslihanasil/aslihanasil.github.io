            I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Financial Economics at Yale University. I
            received my J.D. from Yale Law School in 2021. I received my B.A. in
            Economics summa cum laude from Princeton University in 2017. Upon 
            graduation, I was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. My primary research

              Agencies and legislators have raised concerns that acquisitions
              backed by private equity (PE) threaten competition, but few, if
              any, have offered explanations as to why they pose a unique
              threat. In this article, we argue that PE-backed acquisitions may
              avoid antitrust enforcement because they escape detection. Under
              the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, parties
              intending to merge must notify federal authorities and wait for
              clearance. However, various exemptions exist based on the size of
              the transaction, parties involved, and proportion of control
              conferred by the merger. Recent work demonstrates that to police
              mergers effectively, agencies must be informed about transactions
              in their incipiency, meaning that in many economically important
              industries, the contours of the premerger notification program
              under the Act are, in practice, the same as the contours of the
              substantive legal standard. We show that when the Act’s exemptions
              are applied to PE’s standard investment structure, which use an
              array of intermediate special purpose vehicles to minimize taxes,
              share risks, and distribute fees, many PE-backed acquisitions that
              would otherwise be reportable are exempt. We support our argument
              with merger and filing data.

              Cluster products are complementary goods that have reduced
              transaction costs when purchased from a single company. These
              products are economically important and abundant in markets. A
              notable example is the commercial banking products. In this
              particular market, consumers arguably select banks rather than
              specific banking products, allowing banks to leverage their power
              in one product market, such as loans, to set rates in another
              product market, such as deposits. Although the concept of cluster
              products has roots in seminal Supreme Court decisions from the
              1960s, modern regulatory analysis of proposed bank mergers often
              overlooks this phenomenon. In this paper, we present a structural
              demand and supply model for loans and deposits that accounts for
              the complementarity between these commercial banking products. In
              our model, banks compete in these two product markets by taking
              into consideration the interplay between the demands for both
              products. We use our model to predict the impact of actual mergers
              on deposit and loan rates charged by and market shares of each
              market participant. Subsequently, we compare these predictions to
              the rates and shares that were realized after the studied mergers.

              Generative artificial intelligence is being rapidly deployed for
              corporate tasks including pricing. Suppose one of these machines
              communicates with the pricing manager of a competing firm,
              proposes to collude, receives assent, and raises price. Is this a
              crime under US antitrust laws, and, if so, who is liable? Based on
              the observed behavior of the most widely adopted large language
              model, we argue that this conduct is imminent, would satisfy the
              requirements for agreement and intent under Section 1 of the
              Sherman Act, and confer criminal liability to both firms as well
              as the pricing manager of the competing firm.

              Big Tech companies acquired at least 710 companies since 2000,
              whereas US federal regulators and courts did not block any of
              these deals. Given these figures, it is reasonable to conclude
              that there exists a discrepancy between the industry outlook on
              markets and competition, and that of antitrust authorities. This
              paper suggests defining markets for consumer data using the
              existing U.S. antitrust framework, specifically that of Clayton
              Act §7. It shows how existing tools, such as buyer substitution
              and “practical indicia” of Brown Shoe, sufficiently define markets
              for data that appear to be pivotal in the acquisitions engaged by
              internet platforms. It further applies two existing theories of
              harm, namely unilateral effects of horizontal merger framework and
              foreclosure theory of harm belonging to the vertical merger
              framework, to outline the inclusion of data markets and consumer
              data products in the modern antitrust analysis of M&A activity by
              major internet platforms.
